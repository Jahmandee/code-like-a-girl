    <h1>Our Code of Conduct</h1>

        <p>
          Code Like a Girl was created to bring like-minded people together to
          <em
            >share experiences, knowledge and stories in a supportive and
            inclusive space.</em
          >
          As such, CLG is dedicated to providing a
          <strong
            >safe, fun and most importantly, a harassment-free experience for
            all our community, across all of our services and programs</strong
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          We expect everyone to be treated equally and with respect, regardless
          of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
          disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
          family structure, socio-economic status, religion (or lack thereof),
          or programming language preference.

          We're a deeply accessible community of women and gender minorities, choosing to collaborate and not work against each other. We deeply love our community. We are committed to continue to show up for our community, and those who need our support most. We love it when our community speaks up and gets involved.

            We spur the curiosity in kids and adults, giving them the confidence to fail and enjoy. We use humour to cut through a topic that can often feel tired or heavy/complex. We ask questions, sideline assumptions and always seek to grow our knowledge and understanding - of tech and each other!

            We believe in a smarter path, in taking risks, in creatively challenging the status quo through an action mindset. We love to immerse ourselves in emerging technology and strive to be continuously learning and growing. Only by questioning long-held views and priorities can we make the changes necessary to increase diversity and inclusion in tech.
